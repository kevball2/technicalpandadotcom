My Name is Kevin Oliver, for most of my IT career I have worked in the trenches of IT infrastructure. From Windows 2000 to Azure, I have worked on a range of Microsoft systems and technologies. Recently, I have begun a transformation to a cloud centric role. I am currently studying full time to bring my skills sets up to date with new cloud focused technologies.
