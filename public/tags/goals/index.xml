            With my goals from 2020 still hanging on the wall staring at me shamefully, I am taking the initative to start getting 2022 in order. Taking a chance with a new role in 2020, I have found a re-kindling of my love for learning and discoverying new technology. In this new role I have had to learn a number of new technologies; Azure DevOps, Github Actions, Git and branch management, Azure machine learning, Bicep and ARM template deployment.
